## Description

Endeavor is a MERN stack application that allows users to create, join, and manage events and activities. It's a great way to connect with others who share your interests! Users are able
to create an account, create events, join events, and (in the a future development) leave comments. The application is built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It's a full-stack application that was built with the agile development process. This MERN stack single page application was an assignment from the Ohio State University Coding Bootcamp.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
